## Cloud-Native Notes:

 - Cloud native = building apps that are scalable , resilient , portable
 - Containers -> package the application and its dependencies runs anywhere
 - Microservices -> small services that scale independently 
 - Service mesh -> control communication between the services
 - Infra immutability -> don't edit the servers rebuild
 - Declarative API -> describe what you want?
