## [[Cloud-Native Notes:]]

 - Cloud native = building apps that are scalable , resilient , portable
 - Containers -> package the application and its dependencies runs anywhere
 - Microservices -> small services that scale independently 
 - Service mesh -> control communication between the services
 - Infra immutability -> don't edit the servers rebuild
 - Declarative API -> describe what you want?

**Reflection:** Containers are the base layer â€” without them, microservices and service meshes wouldnâ€™t work.

 ## [[12 Factor]] 

- Config -> Keep in the environment not in the code.
- Process -> The app  should be stateless and no local memory. 
- Dependencies -> Explicitly list out the  library dependences   
- Code base -> one code based tracked deployed many


**Reflection:** The 12-Factor principles are habits that make cloud-native apps easier to build, scale, and manage.
